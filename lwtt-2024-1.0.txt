% Timetable data file for [livewires]
% - input file to go with PHP timetable generator in
%   the [[livewires]] DB
% - contains info for both Team, YP and joint events
% - PHP script decides whether to produce Team or YP
%   version, not this file
% - now adds info on who's leading the activity, for
%   output in the team version.
%
% All fields are tab delimited.
% Don't use ampersands - use plus signs instead!
% First section needs to include the following lines
%   C = RGB colour definitions [multiple allowed]
%   Y = year that this file is for
%   DT = number of days covered in the file (for team)
%	DY = number of days covered in the file (for YP)
% Blank lines ignored.  Comment lines start with %.
% An activity of _DATE_ becomes the current date string
